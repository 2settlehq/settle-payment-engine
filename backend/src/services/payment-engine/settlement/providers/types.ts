/**
 * Settlement Provider Interface

 * Same shape as RateProvider (rate/providers/types.ts) and EnergyRentalProvider
 * (sweeper/energy-rental/types.ts) — implement this to add a new payout rail.
 * Balance tracking and provider selection live outside this interface, in
 * SettlementRouter; a provider only needs to know how to move money.
